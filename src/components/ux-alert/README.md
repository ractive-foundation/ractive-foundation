> Alerts are handy elements you can drop into a form or inline on a page to communicate success, warnings, failure or just information. They'll conform to 100% of the container width you put them in.

Read [Foundation's alert](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/alert_boxes.html) docs for more details.

Markup example:

```html
<ux-alert>
</ux-alert>
```
