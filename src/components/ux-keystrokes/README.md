> If you have keyboard affordances, you might need to explain them to users. For example, to close your browser window hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd>. (Don't actually type that now - there are more docs to read.) Keystroke is a simple character affordance tool.

Read [Foundation's keystrokes](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/keystrokes.html) docs for more details.
